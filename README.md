- 👋 Hi, I’m @uhesdras
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, reading, and coding!
- I'm still a beginner coder, learning more everyday. 
- 🌱 I’m currently reading "The Republic" by Plato and I'm currently learning in Harvard's free CS50 online course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any coding projects that help others learn how to code.
